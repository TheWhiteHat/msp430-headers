These header files were created for [naken430asm]
(http://www.mikekohn.net/micro/naken430asm_msp430_assembler.php).

Currently, no headers are completely finished.

This branch is currently focusing on creating the file layout to resolve all
dependencies for any given controller, such that data is only ever entered
once.

Document Citations
==================
Each header begins with it's name and TI document identifier following in
parentheses. Any further annotations reference a section number within the
document or, if the document is not broken into sections, a page number.
